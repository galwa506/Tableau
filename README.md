# Tableau

This repository contains some of my assignments for the Data Visualization subject, along with various Tableau projects I've worked on for fun. Here, you will find the datasets I have worked on, and you can also try opening my Tableau files in your own Tableau software to explore them.

These are fun and interactive Tableau projects - feel free to check them out and experiment with the visualizations! ðŸš€
